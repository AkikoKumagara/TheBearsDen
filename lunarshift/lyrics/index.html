Deception<br>
My wings have been torn apart<br>
Falling down, I<br>
Recall your name, your voice<br><br>

Betrayed by fate<br>
I can't see anymore<br>
The fire is<br>
Burning me as I fall<br><br>

Seeking answers<br>
as I'm losing my mind<br>
I see a face<br>
As my heart beats intensely<br><br>

The sky turns red<br>
Angels are shooting me down<br>
This is the fate<br>
That God carved in stone<br><br>

Time won't heal my scars<br>
I will... Arise<br><br>

I still haven't forgot of you<br><br>

Going through the endless trials<br>
Seeking a way to survive<br>
In the distance I can sense<br>
A faint light attracting me<br><br>

There's no one to blame<br>
There's no place to go<br>
We just have to look for a way<br>
To take back all that is ours<br><br>

Run for it and don't let go<br>
Take it in our hands<br>
Bringing back the stolen fate<br>
Make the future shine again<br><br>

There's no one to blame<br>
There's no place to go<br>
We just have to look for a way<br>
To take back all that you broke down<br><br>

My wings have been torn apart<br>
Falling down, I<br>
Recall your name, your voice<br><br>

Betrayed by fate<br>
I can't see anymore<br>
The fire is<br>
Burning me as I fall<br><br>

Seeking answers<br>
as I'm losing my mind<br>
I see a face<br>
As my heart beats intensely<br><br>

The sky turns red<br>
Angels are shooting me down<br>
This is the fate<br>
That God carved in stone<br><br>

Time won't heal my scars<br>
I will... Arise<br><br>

I still haven't forgot of you<br><br>

Going through the endless trials<br>
Seeking a way to survive<br>
In the distance I can sense<br>
A faint light attracting me<br><br>

There's no one to blame<br>
There's no place to go<br>
We just have to look for a way<br>
To take back all that is ours<br><br>

Run for it and don't let go<br>
Take it in our hands<br>
Bringing back the stolen fate<br>
Make the future shine again<br><br>

There's no one to blame<br>
There's no place to go<br>
We just have to look for a way<br>
To arise</p></a></center><br><hr>

The world is changing all around us so fast<br>
I don't know how much longer I'll last<br>
I realize that we've been here before<br>
Why can't we see it could be so much more?<br><br>

I just want to believe in something<br>
My whole life has been closing a door<br>
But I'll keep my head up high<br>
Hoping you'll find your way to the light<br><br>

All around me<br>
It's all changing<br>
My whole life<br>
Has been decaying<br><br>

Take a look around us and what do we see?<br>
Bits and pieces of what we wanted to be<br>
Why can't we see just what we have lost?<br>
Why can't we be what we wanted to be?<br><br>

I just want to believe in something<br>
My whole life has been chasing a dream<br>
So I keep my head up high<br>
Hoping you'll find your way to the sky<br><br>

All around me<br>
It's depressing<br>
My whole life<br>
Has been obsessing<br><br>

Picking up the broken pieces is hard<br>
But moving forward has been my trump card<br>
I realize it's nobody's fault<br>
Why can't we make a positive change?<br><br>

I just want to believe in something<br>
I can't put that burden on you<br>
So I keep my head up high<br>
Hoping you'll stay right here by my side</p></a></center><br><hr>

You don't know my name<br>
But you know I'm here with you<br>
I stand suffering<br>
Don't know what's wrong with me<br><br>

Things I can't explain<br>
Words alone won't ease my pain<br>
You won't take away<br>
My will to live one more day<br><br>

I hope that you know<br>
I'll be here when you need me<br>
That won't ever change<br>
It won't ever change<br><br>

I know that you know<br>
But I can't help but worry<br>
That won't ever change<br>
It won't ever change<br><br>

I see a bright sky<br>
My future shines like the stars in the night<br>
I see a new day<br>
The sun rises as my cares fade away<br><br>

Just when I thought I was out<br>
Another trap springs in my step<br>
Something always keeps me in doubt<br>
Won't this hell ever get out of my way<br><br>

Must have been something I said<br>
Another panic in my head<br>
Something always keeps me in doubt<br>
One step forward and three steps back again<br><br>

You can't stop my pain<br>
But you know I'm still breathing<br>
I'm still suffering<br>
Don't know what's wrong with me<br><br>

It won't go away<br>
These things that drive me insane<br>
You can't take away<br>
My will to fight one more day<br><br>

But I need you now<br>
So take my hand and lead me<br>
To another place<br>
Please take me away<br><br>

You can show me how<br>
To live without that worry<br>
In a brand new place<br>
Please take me away<br><br>

I see a bright sky<br>
My future shines like the stars in the night<br>
I see a new day<br>
The sun rises as my cares fade away<br><br>

Just when I thought I was out<br>
Another trap springs in my step<br>
Something always keeps me in doubt<br>
Won't this hell ever get out of my way<br><br>

Must have been something I said<br>
Another daydream in my head<br>
Somehow I defeated my doubt<br>
One step forward a smile on my face</p></a></center><br><hr>

Stuck inside this world with<br>
No concept of color<br>
What is going on here<br>
Somebody please come save me<br><br>

I am lost within this<br>
Everlasting darkness<br>
Hoping for a way to<br>
Be who I want to be<br><br>

There's no way to<br>
Escape from this<br>
So I'll have to<br>
Live my life this way<br><br>

Grasp onto this<br>
Hope that I can<br>
Find a way to<br>
Make it through the day<br><br>

But I know if<br>
I keep trying<br>
I can do it<br>
If I just believe<br><br>

Fairy Tales have<br>
Happy endings<br>
We'll make this one<br>
End with just you and me</p></a></center><br><hr>

All these days gone by that I just<br>
Feel like I can't make it through<br>
All this time I spent alone yet<br>
I can't simply forget you<br><br>

With my heart on my sleeve<br>
I make a move so it won't be like this<br>
But you're only in my mind now<br>
Because you no longer exist<br><br>

Bite!<br><br>

The story of her life's gone by<br>
Those times when I was with you<br><br>

World of make-believe<br>
Take my memories from me<br>
Never forget<br>
The soul I let to die<br><br>

One thing left to lose<br>
Don't give up now<br>
We can save her life again<br>
So just keep on moving<br><br>

Why can't I just make it through this<br>
Like I do with everything?<br>
Why can't I just find a way to<br>
Make it through another day?<br><br>

I hold on to the hope that I<br>
Will find a way to survive<br>
But that hope gets lost inside me<br>
As I forget I'm alive<br><br>

Bite!<br><br>

A story of a life gone by<br>
Those times when I was happy<br><br>

World of make-believe<br>
Make my dreams crumble to dust<br>
Never forget<br>
All that I left behind<br><br>

Nothing left to lose<br>
Give it up now<br>
We can find that life again<br>
So just keep on moving on

Please take my hand<br>
In this drawn out land<br>
Trapped beneath these scribbles and a thousand hues<br>
I could never even forget about you<br><br>

So I tried to free my mind<br>
But you're always there behind me<br>
So I can't ask you to leave<br>
I'm a victim of my own deceit<br><br>

Teach me how to care again<br>
Teach me how to be a friend<br>
I'm right here by your side<br>
All the way to the bitter end<br><br>

Show me the way<br>
You don't have to be afraid<br>
I can help you if you help me<br>
Out of this sketch we will be (We Will Be!)<br><br>

My mind has been erased<br>
Corrupted by your embrace<br>
All that remains are the shavings<br>
Of an afterthought<br><br>
 
Now I'm left unable to tell<br>
Is this Heaven or am I in Hell?<br>
Shred to pieces all that I can<br>
I've had all that I can stand<br><br>

I want to be whole again<br>
One last stroke of a dying pen<br>
That's all that I need to find<br>
My way back to you...
